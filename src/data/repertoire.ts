**Core Idea:** If Black declines the refutation 5...Nxe5! and instead retreats the king (5...Ke8), 6.Qf3 threatens mate on f7 (guarded by the e5 knight) and 7.Qf7# is checkmate.

**Classification:** Tactical theme: king extraction. Attack pattern: queen infiltration. Conversion: checkmate / winning attack. Key concepts: f7 weakness, forcing moves, initiative, exposed king, tempo, mating attack.
